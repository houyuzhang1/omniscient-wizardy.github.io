# **Team Organization Charter**

### **Team Goals** {#team-goals}

1. Developing a unique and whimsical product that can be added to our resumes.   
2. A product that creates and inspires a useful line of products that are made with a focus on practicality  
3. Give priority to safety  
4. An intuitive design is proven through user testing  
5. Delivering a physically sturdy and durable product

### **Mission Statement** {#mission-statement}

Our mission is to innovate the hiking experience by merging functionality with imagination. By creating a technologically advanced staff inspired by the timeless wizard's tool, we aim to empower outdoor enthusiasts with real-time environmental data and navigational insights. Our project demonstrates that practicality and creativity can coexist, paving the way for a new generation of products that are as useful as they are inspiring. We strive to enhance safety, awareness, and adventure for hikers while pushing the boundaries of what everyday objects can achieve in the modern world.

### **Communication Channels and Procedures** {#communication-channels-and-procedures}

| Name | Discord | Email | 
| :---- | :---- | :---- | 
| Gwen Eging | Discord: gubb\_gubb | Email: geging@asu.edu |
| Houyu Zhang | Discord: alpaca\_z | Email: hzhan322@asu.edu |
| Mudit Lal | Discord: muditlal | Email: mlal4@asu.edu |
| SeanMichael Hall | Discord: seanmikeall | email: shall58@asu.edu |

Our team’s primary method of communication is through Discord, with text messages as a backup. These methods can be asynchronous, which is excellent for assigning parts, sharing resources, and discussing logistics. They can also be used synchronously with voice chats, allowing us to work together while discussing our assignments and tasks. 

All correspondence will be done with the professor in person or through email. We can communicate via email as long as the rest of the team is CC’d on the conversation. 

### **Meeting Schedule and Coordination** {#meeting-schedule-and-coordination}

5:45 pm \- 6:30 PM | Mondays and/or Fridays  
45-minute meetings where team members can share ideas, provide updates, and delegate tasks.

To ensure all members are aware of the meetings and do not forget to do so, we will use Google Calendar and message reminders through the chosen communication methods. 

Our team will discuss the meeting changes and ensure that as many members as possible can attend. On occasion, we will have to hold a meeting while missing a member or two. In this case, we will communicate with the missing member(s) with any relevant information after the meeting. 

The preferred method of meeting is in person; however, life is unpredictable. With the use of Discord, we can hold virtual meetings through voice chat and screen sharing. This will also help us stay flexible on meeting times. 

### **Roles and Responsibilities** {#roles-and-responsibilities}

| MEMBER | ROLE |
| ----- | :---: |
| Mudit Lal | Project Monitor |
| Houyu Zhang | Meeting Leader |
| Gwen Eging | Assignment Leader |
| Sean-Michael Hall | Meeting Recorder |

Each team member will pick a role based on the amount of workload that they can tackle. If a team member feels like they need assistance on a specific project assignment, they will communicate with the rest of the team and they will do their best to assist in any way they can. In order for the group to succeed as a whole, we must all be doing our parts and contributing to the team. In addition, the team will check in with one another to make sure that we are all doing the work evenly and effectively. The team will refer to team assignments, documentation, etc in order for the team to reach its milestone and success as a whole.

Roles will change upon team members' request. We will decide who is assigned to each role based on preference. Team members will help through requests over Discord chat. We will identify and respond to situations of role adjustments by discussing them in team meetings. We will track team activities through the project monitor. We will assign technical responsibilities in class.

### **Team Coordination and Accountability** {#team-coordination-and-accountability}

We will ensure each team member checks assignments, that each team member has knowledge of what is required for each assignment, and that feedback is distributed and acted upon by sending assignments into a discord chat pre-submission, updating each other in class, and following up over discord to provide any clarifications, and assigning a member to keep track of feedbacks for us to implement.

Skill and knowledge of an assignment will be verbally distributed in person or remotely. If a team member feels that they don’t have the skill and knowledge to complete a task, the team will comprise the workload to complete the assignment by the assigned deadline.

Team members are assisted and held accountable through discord chats and a possible call if deemed necessary. Underperforming members will receive various warnings and explanations before escalation.

### **Conflict Recognition and Resolution** {#conflict-recognition-and-resolution}

Any conflicts within the group will be tackled as a group. If a team member has any sort of conflict with the group, they will voice their thoughts and concerns to the group and present what needs to be fixed. Therefore, the group will come to a compromise as a whole either in-person or remotely via one of the communication methods that has been established.

## Concept Designs:

### Climate Sensing Drone
# ADD PICTURE![IMG_1172](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8bdc5954-1e0d-4ba9-8f76-7a85ae2519e3)


###### Description:
A drone outfitted with sensors to gather environmental data while in the sky. 

##### Pros:
* Remote access
* Camera
##### Cons:
* National parks banned drones for recreational use
* Hard to navigate with trees
* Requires skill to operate
* Not easy to control while on the go.
* Wind could alter the flight path of the device.
* Requires a remote/controller, which could be a smart device which would complicate the development.  

### Weather Sensing Wizards Hat
# ADD PICTURE

###### Description:
A wearable weather device that gathers wind speed, along with UV index, humidity, and temperature. This information is then converted to the baubles hanging from the rim to alert the user to weather predictions and conditions. 

##### Pros:
* Wearable
* Less distracting, compared to the drone 
##### Cons:
* Combersume to wear
* Communication with the user is difficult 

### Detachable Wizard's Orb
#### Attached to a wizard's staff for concept art. 
# ADD PICTURE

###### Description:
An orb that is detachable from the base, which allows it to be used in ways we have not predicted. Will be equipped with a temperature sensor, UV sensor, and humidity sensor to predict rain and other useful information. The sphere display allows for intuitive graphics and customizable information to be displayed. 

##### Pros:
* Easy to use
* Comprehensive display
* No external device is needed
* Versatile
##### Cons:
* Sphere display could be difficult to implement
* Durability will be a challenge due to design and modularity
